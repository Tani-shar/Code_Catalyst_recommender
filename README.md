# CodeCatalyst: Unified Cross-Domain Recommendation System

*An intelligent, serverless recommendation system that unifies user experiences across Amazon's ecosystem by breaking down data silos and delivering truly personalized recommendations.*

---

## üéØ Overview

CodeCatalyst transforms how users discover content across Amazon's ecosystem. Instead of treating Prime Video, Kindle, and Amazon Music as separate silos, our system creates a unified recommendation experience that understands user preferences holistically.

**Key Innovation**: Cross-domain semantic mapping that connects books, movies, and music in a shared embedding space, enabling intelligent recommendations like suggesting the film adaptation after you finish reading a book.

---

## üöß Problem Statement

### Current Limitations
- **Fragmented Experiences**: Each Amazon service operates independently, missing cross-platform insights
- **Limited Context Awareness**: Traditional systems ignore temporal, emotional, and social contexts
- **Shallow Personalization**: Recommendations rely heavily on genre similarity without understanding deeper user preferences
- **Underutilized Data**: Rich signals from shopping patterns, reading habits, and social interactions remain unexplored

### Business Impact
- Reduced user engagement across services
- Missed cross-selling opportunities
- Lower customer lifetime value
- Suboptimal content discovery experience

## üí° Solution

CodeCatalyst addresses these challenges through:

### üéì Intelligent Cross-Domain Mapping
**Scenario**: Student finishes "The Great Gatsby" on Kindle
**Result**: System recommends ‚Üí 2013 film adaptation on Prime Video ‚Üí Jazz soundtrack on Amazon Music ‚Üí Fitzgerald anthology for purchase

### üé≠ Context-Aware Recommendations
**Scenario**: User listening to melancholic indie music
**Result**: System suggests ‚Üí Matching mood dramas ‚Üí Philosophical books ‚Üí Curated playlists

### üë• Social-First Design

## üî¨ Technical Deep Dive

### Machine Learning Components

#### 1. Collaborative Filtering (Matrix Factorization)
Uses Alternating Least Squares (ALS) for implicit feedback:

```
R_ui ‚âà p_u^T √ó q_i
```

Where:
- `R_ui`: Predicted rating for user u and item i
- `p_u`: User latent factors
- `q_i`: Item latent factors

**Confidence weighting for implicit feedback:**
```
c_ui = 1 + Œ± √ó r_ui
```

#### 2. Content-Based Filtering
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts item metadata (genres, descriptions) into numerical features
- **SBERT Embeddings**: Semantic understanding of content descriptions
- **Cross-Domain Mapping**: Shared embedding space for different content types

**Similarity calculation:**
```
similarity(u, i) = cos(profile_u, features_i) = (profile_u ¬∑ features_i) / (||profile_u|| √ó ||features_i||)
```

#### 3. Contextual Modeling
**Temporal weighting:**
```
temporal_score = 1 / (1 + |current_year - content_year| / decay_factor)
```

**Demographic clustering:**
- Age-based preferences
- Geographic preferences
- Seasonal patterns

#### 4. Hybrid Scoring
```python
final_score = (
    w_cf √ó collaborative_score +
    w_cb √ó content_score +
    w_ctx √ó context_score +
    w_social √ó social_score
)
```

### Cross-Domain Semantic Bridge

Our system maps content across domains using:

1. **Shared Entity Recognition**: Identifies common entities (actors, authors, themes)
2. **Semantic Embeddings**: SBERT-based similarity for cross-domain content
3. **Graph-Based Relationships**: Knowledge graph connecting related items across domains
